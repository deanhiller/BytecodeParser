	BytecodeParser is a java library that can help you statically to parse java
bytecode by extracting as much information as possible. It can also statically
analyze each method's frame, for particular purposes like retrieving the names
of the local variable names given as parameters of a method call (its original
purpose), check if all the frames are reachable, etc.
